	I'm Riley Grace M. Avelino, from BTVTED-EST-1A at the Technological University of the Philippines. <br>
	We are 6 in the family, i have 2 sisters and 1 brother. My older sister has her own family, and I'm currently living with them. <br>
	My brother just graduated from college, and currently working now as a barista at a cafe. <br>
	And lastly, my younger sister is currently a grade 11 student at Arellano University. <br>
	My mother is the one who's taking care of us and our home, while my father is working as a family driver. <br>
	We live in Vitas, Tondo, Manila. I was born and raised here so I've never been in the countryside.

	My hobby is listening to or jamming music. I like R&B/Soul, and I like make-up by Ariana Grande. <br>
	I listen to music when i have time and allow myself to like when i am on my way to school or to go home. <br>
	Or when i'm doing something like cleaning up, doing my homework or doing school activities. <br>
	When i'm on a break or have a whole month free, i spend my time watching movies and series.

	My favorite quote from Mahatma Gandhi is "Be the change you wish to see in this world." <br>
	This means that if we want to see improvements or positive changes in the world, we should start by changing ourselves first. <br>
	By changing our actions and behaviors. Instead of waiting for others to make things better, <br>
	let's remember that our actions can inspire others to follow.

	I still haven't figured out what's my dream. I'm still unsure and i know i will find it out sooner or later. <br>
	While i'm here in the university i'm trying to explore who i am and what i want to do. <br>
	For now, I'm focusing on building my skills like communication and teamwork, which will help me in the future.
